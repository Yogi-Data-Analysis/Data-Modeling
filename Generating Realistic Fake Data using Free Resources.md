# Learn how to make dummy and mock data for your data science projects.

Data is critical, as we all know. The issue is that we frequently do not have (enough of) it. We must test data apps or pipelines with data that is similar to what will be observed in production.

Manually creating realistic datasets of adequate amount and variety is difficult (e.g. different data types, characteristics). Furthermore, data created by hand is prone to systematic and subconscious biases.

Fortunately, there are a number of free web sites that can generate realistic false data for testing purposes. Let's have a look at a few examples:
